================================================================================
2. CAN THIS APPLICATION BE UPLOADED TO THE WEB?
================================================================================

Current Status:
---------------
- This is currently a DESKTOP APPLICATION (Windows .exe file)
- It is NOT a web application
- It runs as a standalone executable on Windows machines

How It Works:
-------------
- The application runs a LOCAL HTTP SERVER on localhost (port 8765)
- This local server serves the 3D viewer files to the user's default browser
- All files are served from the local machine - no external web server needed
- The desktop app acts as a controller, and the browser displays the 3D model

Web Deployment Possibility:
---------------------------
- The application COULD be adapted for web deployment, but would require:
  * Converting the desktop UI to a web interface
  * Setting up a web server (not localhost)
  * Handling file uploads via web interface
  * Managing user sessions and file storage
- Currently, it is designed and built as a desktop application only
- The executable can be distributed to users, but it must run on their local machines

================================================================================
3. DOES THIS APPLICATION REQUIRE INTERNET CONNECTION TO RUN?
================================================================================

Answer: NO - Internet is NOT required for normal operation

Details:
--------
- The application runs completely OFFLINE once installed
- All required libraries (Python packages and JavaScript files) are bundled with the application
- The application uses a LOCAL HTTP SERVER (localhost:8765) - this does not require internet
- All 3D rendering happens locally in the user's browser using local files
- No external API calls or cloud services are used

Initial Setup (One-time):
--------------------------
- During initial setup, you may need internet to:
  * Download Python packages (if installing from source)
  * Download Three.js libraries (if not already included)
- Once the executable is built, NO internet is required

Network Requirements:
---------------------
- The application only uses localhost (127.0.0.1) - no external network access
- No firewall rules needed for external access
- No VPN or internet connection required
- Works in completely isolated/air-gapped environments

================================================================================
4. WHERE IS UPLOADED DATA STORED?
================================================================================

Data Storage Details:
--------------------
- NO PERMANENT STORAGE: The application does NOT save uploaded files permanently
- Files are loaded from the user's local file system (wherever they choose)
- When a file is opened, it is temporarily served via the local HTTP server
- Files remain in their ORIGINAL LOCATION on the user's computer
- The application does NOT copy or move files

Temporary Storage:
-----------------
- The local HTTP server serves files from their original location
- Browser may cache files temporarily in browser cache
- Browser localStorage may store viewer preferences (colors, settings)
- All temporary data is cleared when:
  * User clicks "Clear" button
  * Application is closed
  * Browser cache is cleared

No Database:
------------
- No database is used
- No file upload to cloud storage
- No server-side storage
- All data stays on the user's local machine

File Access:
------------
- Users select files using standard Windows file dialog
- Files are accessed directly from their original location
- No files are copied to application directory
- No files are uploaded anywhere

================================================================================
5. WHAT TYPE OF FILES DOES THIS APPLICATION HANDLE?
================================================================================

Supported File Formats:
-----------------------
- GLTF files (*.gltf) - Text-based 3D model format
- GLB files (*.glb) - Binary version of GLTF
- STL files (*.stl) - 3D printing format (via import feature)
- CSV files (*.csv) - For material color mapping

File Size Limits:
----------------
- No hard-coded file size limit
- Large files (>500MB) will show a warning but can still be loaded
- Performance depends on:
  * System RAM
  * GPU capabilities
  * File complexity (vertex count, texture size)

Compression Support:
--------------------
- Supports Draco-compressed GLTF/GLB files
- Draco compression reduces file size significantly
- Requires draco_decoder_gltf.js (included in application)
